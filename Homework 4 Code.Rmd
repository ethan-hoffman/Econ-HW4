#Question 1
##Read in the damages.csv file and then mutate to set up the quadratic equation
damages <- read.csv(here("data", "damages.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(warm2 = warming^2)

##Create a linear model to find the estimated damage function in the damages data table
damages_lm <- lm(damages ~ warming + warm2, data = damages)
damages_lm[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]] <- 0

##Create data visualization of damages.csv data
ggplot(data = damages, aes (x = warming, y = damages))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data=damages, aes(x=warming, y=damages))+
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 3.5, y = 1000000000000000, label = "y = 1.95 * (10^-13) x^2 - 3.07 * (10^-12) x") +

#Question 2
##Read in the warming.csv file

```{r}
#Question 2
##Use the warming file and estimated damage function from Question 1 to create four plots
###Using the damages lm from Question 1, isolate the coefficient values to create this next graph.
x <- damages_lm[["coefficients"]][["warming"]]
x2 <- damages_lm[["coefficients"]][["warm2"]]
intercept <- damages_lm[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]]

###Find the Difference in Damages over Time that Arise from the Pulse. After finding the difference, divide the difference by 35 billion tons of carbon which is roughly equal to the amount of annual global emissions
warming_difference <- warming %>%
  mutate(damage_base = (warming_baseline*x) + ((warming_baseline)^2*x2) + intercept,
         damage_pulse = (warming_pulse * x) + ((warming_pulse)^2 * x2) + intercept,
         damage_difference = damage_pulse - damage_base,
         damage_annual_cost = damage_difference/35000000000
         )

```{r}
###Damages Over Time without the Pulse
damage_plot <- ggplot(data = warming_difference, aes(x = year, y = damage_base))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()

damage_plot

###Damages Over Time with the Pulse
damage_pulse_plot <- ggplot(data = warming_difference, aes(x = year, y = damage_pulse))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()

damage_pulse_plot

###Damage difference Over Time without the Pulse
damage_difference_plot <- ggplot(data = warming_difference, aes(x = year, y = damage_difference))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()

damage_difference_plot

###Damage difference over time per ton of carbon
damage_ton_plot <- ggplot(data = warming_difference, aes(x = year, y = damage_annual_cost)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()

#Question 3
##Create a plot of SCC vs. Discount Rate


warming_scc <- warming_difference %>% 
  mutate(Discount1 = ((sum(warming_scc$damage_annual_cost))/(1+0.01)^80),
         Discount2 = ((sum(warming_scc$damage_annual_cost))/(1+0.02)^80),
         Discount3 = ((sum(warming_scc$damage_annual_cost))/(1+0.03)^80),
         Discount4 = ((sum(warming_scc$damage_annual_cost))/(1+0.04)^80),
         Discount5 = ((sum(warming_scc$damage_annual_cost))/(1+0.05)^80))

scc_table <- warming_scc %>% 
  select("Discount1", "Discount2", "Discount3", "Discount4", "Discount5") %>% 
  select(,2)

scc_table

ggplot(data = warming_scc, aes(x = c[1,2,3,4,5], y = ))
