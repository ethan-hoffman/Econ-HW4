#Question 1
##Read in the damages.csv file and then mutate to set up the quadratic equation
damages <- read.csv(here("data", "damages.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(warm2 = warming^2)

##Create a linear model to find the equation in the damages data table
damages_lm <- lm(damages ~ warming + warm2, data = damages)
damages_lm[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]] <- 0

##Read in the warming.csv file
warming <- read.csv(here("data", "warming.csv"))

##Create data visualization of damages.csv data
ggplot(data = damages, aes (x = warming, y = damages))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data=damages, aes(x=warming, y=damages))+
  theme_minimal()
